# Service Mesh

The use of Kubernetes to run workloads has become the standard in most organizations.  
While this has many advantages, it also introduces some challengesâ€”especially around managing communication between services.  
Kubernetes abstracts away much of the underlying network, making it difficult to troubleshoot problems and ensure that services are communicating reliably and securely.

**Service mesh** technologies offer a robust and effective solution to these challenges.  
By adopting a sidecar approach, a service mesh provides a centralized way of managing service-to-service communication.  
This approach brings a wide range of features such as:

- **Traffic management** (load balancing, traffic splitting, retries, timeouts)
- **Observability** (metrics, tracing, logging)
- **Security** (mutual TLS, policy enforcement, access control)
- **Resilience** (circuit breaking, fault injection)
- **Service discovery** and more

Two of the leading service meshes for Kubernetes are **Istio** and **Linkerd**.  
Both are graduated projects in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Other open source service mesh tools include:

- **Consul** (by HashiCorp)
- **Open Service Mesh** (OSM, by Microsoft)
- **Network Service Mesh** (NSM)
- **Kuma** (by Kong)
- **AWS App Mesh**
- **Traefik Mesh**

These platforms offer a variety of features to help improve the reliability, performance, and security of microservices-based applications.

## Service Mesh Architecture

A typical service mesh consists of two main planes:

- **Data Plane:**  
  Consists of lightweight proxies (sidecars) deployed alongside each application instance. These proxies intercept and manage all network traffic between services.

- **Control Plane:**  
  Manages and configures the proxies to enforce policies and collect telemetry. The control plane provides APIs for operators to define routing, security, and observability rules.

## Example: Istio Control Plane Components

The Istio control plane consists of the following components:

- **Istiod:** The central control plane component in Istio. It manages configuration, service discovery, certificate issuance, and policy enforcement.
- **Pilot:** Handles service discovery and traffic management (now merged into Istiod).
- **Galley:** Used to validate and process configuration (now deprecated, functionality merged into Istiod).
- **Citadel:** Handles issuing and managing TLS certificates for secure service-to-service communication (now merged into Istiod).

> **Note:** In recent versions, Istio has consolidated most control plane functionality into the `istiod` component.

## Key Features of a Service Mesh

- **Automatic mTLS:** Encrypts traffic between services by default.
- **Traffic Shaping:** Canary releases, A/B testing, blue-green deployments.
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing, metrics, and logging for all service-to-service traffic.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Fine-grained access control and rate limiting.
- **Resilience:** Retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and fault injection.

## When to Use a Service Mesh

- You have many microservices and need consistent, centralized management of traffic, security, and observability.
- You require advanced deployment strategies (canary, blue-green, etc.).
- You need to enforce security policies (mTLS, RBAC) between services.
- You want deep visibility into service-to-service communication.

## When Not to Use a Service Mesh

- Your application is simple or monolithic.
- You have only a few services and do not need advanced traffic management or security features.
- You want to minimize operational complexity and resource overhead.
