# Centralize Logs in Kubernetes Cluster

Centralized logging in Kubernetes involves deploying a DaemonSet for a logging agent that collects logs from all pods and nodes, then forwards them to one or more log storage backends. This approach enables you to aggregate, search, and analyze logs from across your entire cluster in a single place.

## Popular Centralized Logging Solutions

- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):**  
  The most well-known solution. Logstash collects and processes logs, Elasticsearch stores them, and Kibana provides dashboards and search.  
  *Note:* Logstash can be resource-intensive. Alternatives like Filebeat, Fluentd, and Fluent Bit are often used as lighter log shippers.

- **Graylog:**  
  A powerful, open-source log management platform. Graylog provides real-time analysis, alerting, and dashboards. It uses Elasticsearch for log storage and MongoDB for metadata. Graylog is known for its efficient performance and flexible architecture.

- **Fluentd & Fluent Bit:**  
  Both are log collectors and forwarders. Fluent Bit is a lightweight, high-performance alternative to Fluentd, suitable for resource-constrained environments. Fluentd offers more plugins and flexibility, while Fluent Bit is easier to deploy and maintain.

## How It Works

1. **Log Collection:**  
   A logging agent (e.g., Fluent Bit, Filebeat) runs as a DaemonSet on each node, collecting logs from containers and system components.

2. **Log Forwarding:**  
   The agent forwards logs to a central log processor or directly to a storage backend (e.g., Elasticsearch, Graylog).

3. **Storage & Analysis:**  
   Logs are indexed and stored in a backend (Elasticsearch, Graylog, Loki, etc.), where they can be searched, visualized, and analyzed.

## Example: Fluent Bit + Graylog

- **Fluent Bit** collects logs from all pods and forwards them to Graylog.
- **Graylog** provides a web UI for searching, alerting, and dashboarding.

### Fluent Bit DaemonSet Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit
  namespace: logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: fluent-bit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: fluent-bit
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluent-bit
        image: fluent/fluent-bit:latest
        env:
        - name: GRAYLOG_HOST
          value: "graylog.logging.svc.cluster.local"
        - name: GRAYLOG_PORT
          value: "12201"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: varlog
          mountPath: /var/log
        - name: varlibdockercontainers
          mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log
      - name: varlibdockercontainers
        hostPath:
          path: /var/lib/docker/containers
```

### Fluent Bit Output Configuration (to Graylog/GELF)

```ini
[OUTPUT]
    Name        gelf
    Host        ${GRAYLOG_HOST}
    Port        ${GRAYLOG_PORT}
```

## Why Use Graylog?

- **Efficient log ingestion and search**
- **Customizable dashboards and alerts**
- **Scalable and open-source**
- **Integrates with Kubernetes and cloud-native environments**

## Other Notable Solutions

- **Loki (Grafana):** Optimized for Kubernetes, stores logs in a cost-effective way, integrates with Grafana dashboards.
- **Filebeat:** Lightweight log shipper from Elastic, often used as an alternative to Logstash.
