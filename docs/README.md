# What is the Handbook?

The Handbook is my dedicated personal website for organizing and tracking my notes on various computer science topics. It serves as a central hub where I can collect, categorize, and easily access my insights and learnings.

From algorithms and data structures to software development practices and system architecture, the Handbook allows me to document my thoughts, share knowledge, and revisit important concepts whenever needed.

My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that reflects my journey in the field of computer science, making it easier to find information and foster a deeper understanding of the subjects I am passionate about.
