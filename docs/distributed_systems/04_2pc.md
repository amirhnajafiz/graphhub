# 2 Phase Commit

The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol is a distributed algorithm used to ensure all participants in a distributed transaction either commit or abort the transaction, maintaining consistency across the system.

## Key Concepts

- **Coordinator:** The node that manages the commit process.
- **Participant:** Nodes that take part in the transaction and respond to the coordinator.
- **Atomicity:** Ensures that all nodes agree on the outcome (commit or abort).

## 2PC Phases

1. **Prepare Phase:**  
   - The coordinator sends a prepare request to all participants, asking if they can commit.
   - Each participant replies with a vote: "Yes" (ready to commit) or "No" (cannot commit).

2. **Commit Phase:**  
   - If all participants vote "Yes," the coordinator sends a commit message, and all participants commit the transaction.
   - If any participant votes "No," the coordinator sends an abort message, and all participants abort the transaction.

## Safety and Fault Tolerance

- 2PC ensures atomicity but is not fault-tolerant: if the coordinator fails during the commit phase, participants may be left in an uncertain state (blocking problem).
- 2PC does not handle network partitions or Byzantine faults.

## Use Cases

- Distributed databases
- Distributed transaction processing
- Financial systems requiring atomic operations
