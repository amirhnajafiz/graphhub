# Computer Systems Security

Security is the degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm.
It applies to any vulnerable and valuable asset.

## CIA

Computer security is about __CIA__:

- __Confidentiality__: Keeping data hidden and protected from unauthorized disclosure.
- __Integrity__: Data and programs are modified in specified and authorized ways. (meaning that they are honest)
- __Availability__: Systems and networks are available for use by legitimate users.

## Why computer security it hard?

- Security often is not a primary consideration.
- Feature-rich systems tend to be complex.
- Implementations are buggy.
- Networks are more open and accessible than ever.
- Many attacks exploit the weakest link in the chain which are humans.
- Security is hard to test for.
- It requires a deep understanding of all technologies involved in the design and implementation of a system.
- Asymmetry between attack and defense.
