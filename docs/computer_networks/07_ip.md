# IP

The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It is responsible for addressing, routing, and delivering packets across interconnected networks.

## Key Concepts

- **IP Addressing:** Each device on a network is assigned a unique IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) for identification and communication.
- **Packet Switching:** Data is divided into packets, each routed independently through the network.
- **Best-Effort Delivery:** IP does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction; these are handled by higher layers.

## IP Versions

- **IPv4:** 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), supports ~4.3 billion addresses.
- **IPv6:** 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8::1), supports a vastly larger address space.

## Routing

Routing is the process of selecting paths for traffic in a network. Routers use routing tables and protocols to determine the best path for each packet.

### Types of Routing

- **Static Routing:** Manually configured routes.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Routes are automatically updated using routing protocols.

## Routing Algorithms

### Distance Vector Routing

- **How it Works:** Each router maintains a table (vector) of the best-known distance to each destination and periodically shares this table with its neighbors.
- **Updates:** Routers update their tables based on information from neighbors, using algorithms like Bellman-Ford.
- **Pros:** Simple to implement, low overhead.
- **Cons:** Slower convergence, susceptible to routing loops and the "count-to-infinity" problem.
- **Example Protocol:** RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
- **Operation:** Routers send periodic updates to neighbors, advertising their routing tables. Each entry contains the destination network, distance (hop count), and the next hop. If a router receives a better (shorter) path, it updates its table. If a route becomes unreachable, routers increment the distance until it reaches infinity (route is removed).

### Link State Routing

- **How it Works:** Each router has a complete map of the network's topology. Routers exchange information about the state of their links (connections) with all other routers.
- **Updates:** Routers use algorithms like Dijkstra's to compute the shortest path to each destination.
- **Pros:** Faster convergence, more scalable, less prone to routing loops.
- **Cons:** More complex, higher memory and CPU usage.
- **Example Protocol:** OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
- **Operation:** Routers flood link-state advertisements (LSAs) throughout the network, describing their directly connected links. Each router builds a link-state database and computes the shortest path tree to all destinations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Inter-AS and Intra-AS Routing

### Intra-AS Routing (Interior Gateway Protocols, IGP)

- **Definition:** Routing within a single Autonomous System (AS), typically under one administrative domain.
- **Protocols:** RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS.
- **Characteristics:** Optimized for fast convergence and scalability within an organization or ISP.

### Inter-AS Routing (Exterior Gateway Protocols, EGP)

- **Definition:** Routing between different Autonomous Systems, often between ISPs or large organizations.
- **Protocol:** BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
- **Characteristics:** Focuses on policy-based routing, scalability, and stability across the global Internet. BGP routers exchange reachability information and select routes based on policies, not just shortest path.

### Common Routing Protocols

- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Distance-vector protocol, simple but limited scalability.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Link-state protocol, widely used in large enterprise networks.
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** Cisco proprietary, combines features of distance-vector and link-state.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Path-vector protocol, used for routing between autonomous systems on the Internet.

#### BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

- Used to exchange routing information between different organizations (autonomous systems).
- Ensures data can travel across the global Internet.
- Supports policy-based routing and path selection.
