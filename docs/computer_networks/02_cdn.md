# CDN

## What is a CDN?

- CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location.

## How CDNs Work

1. Content is cached on multiple servers worldwide.
2. User requests are routed to the nearest CDN server.
3. This reduces latency and speeds up content delivery.

## Benefits of CDNs

- Faster load times for users.
- Reduced bandwidth costs for website owners.
- Improved availability and reliability.
- Protection against traffic spikes and some attacks.

## Common Uses

- Serving static assets (images, CSS, JS).
- Streaming media content.
- Distributing software updates.

## Summary

CDNs improve website performance and reliability by delivering content from servers closer to users.
